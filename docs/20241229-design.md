A Tangible Story Development Environment

## Origin

From the earlies cave painting to the current age of generative AI, we have been a storytelling species for millennia.

Stories help us share and relive an experience beyond the limits of space and time.

### Symbolic intelligence

> When you think about a language, what are the means of combination and means of abstraction? - Harold Abelson, MIT 6.001 Structure and Interpretation, 1986

Language allowed symbolic manipulation at to tackle complexity at incredible scale.

...but also, enabled us to play.

### A new frontier

Today's AI already understands symbols:

> ⚙️ System: Translate the symbolism into a one sentence story
>
> 🧑 User: A sphere enters a box, a triangle spins.
>
> 🤖 Assistant: A new idea challenges the status quo, causing a shift in perspective.

Tomorrow's AI will work with the physical world.
